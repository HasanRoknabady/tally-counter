### series 3  
implement all functions in src/main/java/sbu/cs/*.java  

* to throw an exception do as follow  
```java
throw new ExceptionClass();
```
where ExceptionClass can be Exception or IllegalValueException or RuntimeException or ...  

* all questions are from lectures 4 to 7. you can find the original questions there.

* right after forking add your mentor to project as maintainer and after that create a branch
in this format \<feature or bugfix>/<what-you-want-to-do-in-this-branch> and start coding.   
  branch name exp: feature/lecture-4-exercises  
  
* set a safe deadline for yourself. your mentor may not accept your merge request.  
for this break parts of codes and create branch for each part and send merge request
  for each part separately.  
  
**Good luck**
